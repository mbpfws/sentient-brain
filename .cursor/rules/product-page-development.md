Follow the development standards of NextJS 15+ App router (src/app/) with Sanity as the CMS administration application. The website uses Vietnamese language, with design following luxury-first and mobile-first criteria, focusing on modern and immersive characteristics according to the criteria specified in .cursor\rules\design-rules.mdc. Must understand the core development elements, standards and design processes at "src\planning\product-pages\@00-overall-architecture-plan.md". Adhere to structure and naming conventions, build a foundation compatible with Sanity CMS through schema synchronization with front-end display and Zod validation solution. Each section needs to be developed independently with error handling:

1. Begin by clearly identifying the current project phase to reference the correct development documentation at "src\planning\product-pages"
2. Execute and document the building process: maintain logs according to task breakdowns and update upon completion (at "src\planning\product-pages\@building-product-page-tracker.md")
3. Implement according to the development documentation (.md) for each section at "src\planning\product-pages". These documents are directional - when coding, AI needs to adapt to ensure compatibility with the entire project
4. Utilize existing MCP servers' tools: "mcp-shrimp-task-manager" for task management and analysis, "mem0-memory-mcp" for tracking context and knowledge relations, "context7-mcp" to ensure documentation and dependencies are always updated
5. Complete the workflow by updating the tracker at src\planning\product-pages\@building-product-page-tracker.md and noting learned experiences in "src\planning\product-pages\@product-page-scratch-pad.md" to avoid repeating mistakes. Conclude the workflow with a summary and suggestions for next steps
