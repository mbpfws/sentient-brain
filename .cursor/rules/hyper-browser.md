Scrape, extract structured data, and crawl webpages effortlessly. Enhance your applications with powerful web scraping capabilities and structured data extraction tools.

Tools
scrape_webpage
Scrape a webpage and extract its content in various formats. This tool allows fetching content from a single URL with configurable browser behavior options. Use this for extracting text content, HTML structure, collecting links, or capturing screenshots of webpages.

crawl_webpages
Crawl a website starting from a URL and explore linked pages. This tool allows systematic collection of content from multiple pages within a domain. Use this for larger data collection tasks, content indexing, or site mapping.

extract_structured_data
Extract structured data from a webpage. This tool allows you to extract structured data from a webpage using a schema.

browser_use_agent
This tool employs an open-source browser automation agent optimized specifically for fast, efficient, and cost-effective browser tasks using a cloud browser. It requires explicit, detailed instructions to perform highly specific interactions quickly. Optimal for tasks requiring: - Precise, explicitly defined interactions and actions - Speed and efficiency with clear, unambiguous instructions - Cost-effective automation at scale with straightforward workflows Best suited use cases include: - Explicitly defined registration and login processes - Clearly guided navigation through web apps - Structured, step-by-step web scraping with detailed guidance - Extracting data via explicitly specified browser interactions You must provide extremely detailed step-by-step instructions, including exact elements, actions, and explicit context. Clearly define the desired outcome for optimal results. Returns the completed result or an error message if issues arise. Note: This agent trades off flexibility for significantly faster performance and lower costs compared to Claude and OpenAI agents.

openai_computer_use_agent
This tool utilizes OpenAI's model to autonomously execute general-purpose browser-based tasks with balanced performance and reliability using a cloud browser. It handles complex interactions effectively with practical reasoning and clear execution. Optimal for tasks requiring: - Reliable, general-purpose browser automation - Clear, structured interactions with moderate complexity - Efficient handling of common web tasks and workflows Best suited use cases include: - Standard multi-step registration or form submissions - Navigating typical web applications requiring multiple interactions - Conducting structured web research tasks - Extracting data through interactive web processes Provide a clear step-by-step description, necessary context, and expected outcomes. Returns the completed result or an error message if issues arise.

claude_computer_use_agent
This tool leverages Anthropic's Claude model to autonomously execute complex browser tasks with sophisticated reasoning capabilities using a cloud browser. It specializes in handling intricate,
