# Step-by-Step Codebase Memory Layer Development for MCP Servers

Let me address your concerns about establishing workflows between client-side and server-side AI agents, and provide a comprehensive approach to building the codebase memory layer that complements your document memory system.

## Workflow Sequence Establishment and Agent Coordination

### Client-Server Coordination Patterns

The workflow establishment between client-side (Cursor/Windsurf) and server-side agents follows a sophisticated multi-phase coordination pattern [1]. When users provide prompts like "build me", "develop", "fix", or "improve", the system follows this sequence:

1. **Query Analysis Phase**: The client-side agent analyzes the user prompt and determines if it's vague or requires clarification [1]
2. **Context Discovery Phase**: The system identifies what codebase knowledge nodes and document clusters are needed [1]
3. **Resource Coordination Phase**: Client and server agents coordinate to pull relevant knowledge from both codebase memory and document memory layers [1]

LangGraph provides excellent orchestration capabilities for this type of multi-agent coordination, supporting dynamic state management and enabling agents to maintain dialogue context while automating complex workflows [2]. The framework's graph-based structure allows agents to execute complex tasks, adapt to new inputs, and provide real-time feedback during distributed environments [3].

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Strategy

Research shows that multi-agent hierarchical workflows can significantly improve code generation and analysis tasks [4]. The coordination follows a supervisor-worker relationship where the supervisor routes tasks between specialized agents based on requirements [5]. This approach enables:

- **Hierarchical task delegation** with multiple levels of supervision [5]
- **Real-time decision making** about which agent should act next [5] 
- **Seamless coordination** between research, coding, and analysis agents [5]

## Codebase Memory Layer Architecture: AST-Based Approach

### Abstract Syntax Tree Foundation

Your observation about AST-based codebase memory is absolutely correct. Abstract Syntax Trees provide superior code understanding compared to simple text chunking because they capture the structural essence of code and facilitate comprehensive analysis of code similarity [6]. ASTs represent syntactic constructs like functions, loops, and variables in a hierarchical tree structure [7].

The key advantages of AST-based codebase memory include:

- **Structural Understanding**: ASTs capture code structure that enables deep keyword search for relevancy across functions, classes, attributes, and types [6]
- **Cross-Language Support**: Modern AST parsers support multiple programming languages including TypeScript, Python, Java, and others [8]
- **Semantic Relationships**: ASTs enable detection of code relationships like function calls, inheritance, and dependencies [9]

### AST Parsing Implementation Strategy

For TypeScript and multi-language support, Tree-sitter emerges as the optimal choice for AST parsing [8]. It provides fast parsing capabilities across various programming languages and supports efficient traversal of concrete syntax trees [8]. The implementation approach involves:

```typescript
// AST parsing with Tree-sitter for codebase indexing
import Parser from 'tree-sitter';
import TypeScript from 'tree-sitter-typescript';

const parser = new Parser();
parser.setLanguage(TypeScript.typescript);

function parseCodebaseToAST(sourceCode: string) {
    const tree = parser.parse(sourceCode);
    return extractCodeStructure(tree.rootNode);
}
```

Advanced AST processing techniques show that hierarchical splitting and reconstruction of ASTs can significantly improve code understanding [10]. This approach first hierarchically splits large ASTs into subtrees, then reconstructs them to capture rich structural information [10].

## Database Infrastructure Choice: Weaviate vs Neo4j Analysis

### Neo4j Strengths for AST Storage

The YouTube example you referenced demonstrates Neo4j's natural fit for AST representation [11]. Neo4j excels at storing AST structures because:

- **Native Graph Structure**: Graph databases are inherently suited for tree and graph representations like ASTs [11]
- **Relationship Traversal**: Quick traversal of parent/child/sibling nodes and semantic relationships [11]
- **Cross-File Connections**: Ability to connect function definitions to usages across multiple files [11]
- **Cypher Query Language**: Powerful query capabilities for complex code analysis patterns [11]

Research demonstrates that Neo4j can effectively represent codebase knowledge graphs with comprehensive relationship mapping including IMPORTS, EXPORTS, CALLS, EXTENDS, IMPLEMENTS, and other code relationships [9].

### Weaviate Advantages for Hybrid Search

However, your existing Weaviate infrastructure offers significant advantages for codebase memory that complement AST analysis [12]:

- **Hybrid Search Capabilities**: Combines vector similarity search with keyword search using sophisticated fusion algorithms [12]
- **Semantic Understanding**: Vector embeddings capture semantic similarities between code snippets that pure structural analysis might miss [12]
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Can combine AST structural data with semantic embeddings and documentation [12]

### Recommended Hybrid Architecture

Based on the analysis, I recommend a **hybrid approach** that leverages both technologies:

1. **Weaviate for Semantic Layer**: Store code embeddings, semantic relationships, and hybrid search capabilities
2. **Neo4j for Structural Layer**: Store pure AST relationships, call graphs, and dependency structures  
3. **Unified Interface**: Create a coordination layer that queries both databases based on query type

Research supports this approach, showing that combining Weaviate's vector search with Neo4j's graph capabilities creates powerful retrieval systems that understand both content and connections within data [13].

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: AST Processing Pipeline (Weeks 1-2)

**Week 1: AST Parser Setup**
- Implement Tree-sitter based AST parsing for TypeScript/JavaScript [8]
- Create AST node extraction for functions, classes, variables, and imports
- Build relationship mapping between code entities

**Week 2: Knowledge Graph Construction**
- Set up Neo4j instance for structural relationships [11]
- Implement AST to graph conversion pipeline
- Create relationship types (CALLS, EXTENDS, IMPLEMENTS, REFERENCES) [9]

### Phase 2: Semantic Integration (Weeks 3-4)

**Week 3: Weaviate Integration**
- Extend existing Weaviate schema for codebase objects
- Implement code embedding generation using semantic models
- Create hybrid search capabilities for code queries

**Week 4: Cross-Database Coordination**

## Workflow Sequence Implementation

### Prompt Understanding and Context Retrieval

When users provide development prompts, the system should follow this enhanced workflow:

1. **Intent Classification**: Use LLM to classify whether prompt requires codebase context, documentation, or both
2. **Codebase Query Generation**: Convert user intent into specific code structure queries
3. **Multi-Database Retrieval**: Query both Neo4j (for structural relationships) and Weaviate (for semantic similarity)
4. **Context Synthesis**: Combine structural and semantic results into coherent code context
5. **Response Generation**: Provide contextually-aware responses using retrieved codebase knowledge

### Integration with Document Memory

The codebase memory layer should seamlessly integrate with your existing document memory system by:

- **Cross-Referencing**: Link code entities to relevant documentation chunks in Weaviate
- **Unified Context**: Combine code structure understanding with documentation knowledge
- **Relationship Mapping**: Create metadata connections between code dependencies and framework documentation

This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both AST-based structural analysis (as shown in your referenced example) and your existing Weaviate infrastructure, creating a comprehensive knowledge system that understands both code structure and semantic relationships [15].

The implementation maintains compatibility with your existing infrastructure while adding powerful code analysis capabilities that will significantly enhance the AI agents' ability to understand and work with complex codebases [16].
