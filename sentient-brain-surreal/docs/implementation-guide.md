## SurrealDB Multi-Model Architecture ImplementationSurrealDB serves as the unified foundation for all memory layers, leveraging its versatile data model capabilities [4]. The implementation strategy maximizes SurrealDB's strengths across different data paradigms:

### Unified Data Schema Design**Knowledge Nodes Structure:**
```sql
-- Document```tity with vector```beddings
CREATE doc:```umentation SET```    title: "API```ference Guide```    content```Comprehensive API```cumentation..```
    embedding``` [0.123, 0.456, ...], // Vector embeddings
    tech```ack: ["Node.js", "Express", "MongoDB"],
    chunk```pe: "api_reference",
    project```: "project```3"
};

-- Code entity```th AST relationships```CREATE code```nction_auth SET {
    name```authenticateUser",
    file```th: "/src/auth/index.js",
    ast```gnature: {...},
    dependencies:``` ["bcrypt", "jsonwebtoken"],
    project_id: "```ject_123"
};

-- Establish```lationships```LATE doc:documentation->REFERENCES```ode:function_auth;
```

### Graph Relationship ModelingSurrealDB's native graph capabilities enable sophisticated relationship tracking [4]:

- **Code Dependencies:** Function calls, class inheritance, module imports
- **Documentation Links:** Cross-references between docs and code implementations  
- **Task Relationships:** Dependencies, blocking conditions, completion requirements
- **Knowledge Bridges:** AI-generated connections between disparate concepts## Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework### LangGraph Implementation StrategyLangGraph provides the optimal framework for complex, stateful workflows with sophisticated agent coordination [1]. The implementation leverages cyclical graphs for advanced reasoning and state management.**Core Workflow Architecture:**
```python
from langgraph import```ateGraph, END```om pydantic import BaseModel```lass AgentState(BaseModel```    user_query: str
    project```ntext: dict```  current_phase: str
    agent```tputs: dict```  memory_context```ict

# Define the```rkflow graph```rkflow = StateGraph```entState)

# Add agent```des
workflow.ad```ode("orchestrator", ultra```chestrator_agent)
workflow.```_node("architect", architect_agent)
workflow.add_```e("codebase_analyzer", codebase_```nt)
workflow.add_node("debugger", debug_agent```# Define conditional```ges
workflow.ad```onditional_edges(
    "orchestrator```    determine```xt_agent,
    {
        "new```oject": "architect",```      "existing```oject": "c```base_analyzer",
        "debug```quest": "debugger"```  }
)
```

### CrewAI Integration for Specialized TeamsCrewAI complements LangGraph by providing role-based agent teams for specialized tasks [2]. Each "department" operates as a CrewAI crew with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.

**Architectural Department Implementation:**
```python
from crewai import```ent, Task, Crew```esearch_agent = Agent(
    role="```earch & Transformer```    goal="```ch prompts with```dustry standards```d enhance requirements```    backstory```xpert in technology```alysis and requirement```hancement",
    tools```[groq_llm_tool, web_search_tool]
)

wireframe_agent = Agent```   role="Wireframe & Structure```signer", 
    goal="```ate step-by-step visual```lustrations``` development```cisions",
    backstory```pecialized in UI/UX```sign and system```chitecture visualization```    tools=[diagram_generation_tool, design_analysis_tool]
)

architect```ew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent, wireframe_agent, prd_agent],
    tasks=[research_task, wireframe_task, prd_task],
    verbose=True``````

## Groq API Integration for High-Performance InferenceThe Groq API provides exceptional inference speed crucial for real-time agent coordination [9]. Integration across all agents ensures consistent performance and rapid response times.

### Implementation Framework**Unified Groq Client:**
```python
from groq import Gro```mport async```
class GroqLLMService:
    def __```t__(self, api```y: str):
        self.client```Groq(api_key=api_key)
        ```f.model = "llama-3.1-70b-versatile"```  
    async def generate```sponse(self, prompt: str,```ntext: dict) -> str:
        """```h-speed inference for```ent decision```king"""
        ```ponse = await self.```ent.chat.completions.ac```te(
            ```el=self.model,
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": f"Context: {context}"},
                {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
            ],
            temperature```1,
            max_```ens=2048
        )
        ```urn response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Performance OptimizationResearch demonstrates that Groq-powered LLM pipelines can process 5,000+ articles daily with significant performance improvements [11]. For the agentic system, this translates to:

- **Sub-second response times** for agent decision-making
- **Parallel processing** across multiple agents without performance degradation  
- **Cost optimization** through efficient token usage and request batching

## Advanced Integration: Coral Protocol & Fetch.ai### Coral Protocol ImplementationCoral Protocol enables sophisticated agent-to-agent communication through standardized messaging formats and secure team formation [13]. Integration transforms the system into a participant in the broader "Internet of Agents."**Coral Agent Adapter:**
```python
from coral_```tocol import Agent``` CoralAgent,```read

class SentientBr```CoralAgent(CoralAgent):
    def __init__(self, m```server):
        super().__init__()
        ```f.mcp_server = mcp_```ver
        self.```abilities = [
            "codebase_analysis",
            "documentation_synthesis", 
            "architectural_planning"
        ]
    
    async def handle```quest(self, request:```ct) -> dict:
        """Process```quests from```her Coral agents"""
        ```request["type"] == "codebase_```lysis":
            return```ait self.m```server.analyze_codebase(request["data"])
        elif request```ype"] == "documentation_synthesis":```          return await self.```_server.synthesize_docs```quest["data"])
```

### Fetch.ai uAgents IntegrationFetch.ai's uAgents framework enables decentralized agent discovery and economic interactions [12]. This integration positions the system within a broader agent marketplace.

**uAgent Implementation:**
```python
from uagents import Agent,```ntext
from uagents.```up import fun```gent_if_low

# Create a sent```t-brain proxy```ent
sentient_agent = Agent```   name="sentient-brain-proxy",
    seed="sent```t_brain_seed_phrase",
    port```01,
    endpoint```["http://localhost:8001/submit"]
)

@sentient_agent.on_message```async def handle```rvice_request(ctx: Context, request):
    """Handle service```quests from the```tch.ai network```
    service```pe = request.```("service_type")
    
    if service_type ==```ode_analysis":
        ```ult = await analyze```debase_service(request["data"])
        await```x.send(request.sender, {"result```result})
```
